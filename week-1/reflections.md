##1.1 Think About Time reflection
I am going to keep this short and sweet, as I have found that keeping things so has been the key to my past success. 

The productivity idea I most identified with was the concept of getting insanely micro (seen here (Links to an external site.)). My biggest weakness in the past has been to plow through everything in front of me with brute force. This would often lead to me getting stressed out and accomplishing nothing. What works for me now is to take the time to work on smaller chunks of an assignment in a given amount of time. This is where the concept of Time Boxing comes in: creating a set amount of time for a specific task. While it is good to take the time to give each component of assignment time and attention, one must realistically set a deadline for each of them. Keeping a steady pace while maintaining a general inquisitiveness about the subject will keep me in the groove. After all, these are not chores I must get done, but challenges I get to accomplish. 


##1.2 The Command Line Reflection

In today's lesson, I was presented with the essential commands for operating my computer through the terminal (Linux commands in Git Bash in my environment). Everything that I would normally do with files via the graphic interface of my Windows machine could be done much quicker with these few commands. Some of it was intuitive while other commands were not as obvious to begin with. The best way to see whether I was making a connection between the commands and what I would see in the usual interface was to directly compare the two. This was especially helpful when moving/renaming files. The command line allowed me to think about the system in its purest, simplest ways. Now that I have done the basic crash course, I will have to repeat it and spend some time reviewing and fooling around with it as much possible.

The slightly dangerous thing with these commands is that I now I have the power to do serious harm to my computer if I'm not paying attention. I deleted several files in these exercises because I kept running commands without thinking. Attention to detail is key here!
