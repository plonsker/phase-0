<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?: For the most part, it came easily after deciding with my peer on the general layout (a table containing the site's links instead of an unordered list). While it was tedious to replicate all the links and text, structuring the site itself was an enjoyable experience. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements? My peer seemed much more knowledgeable about this topic and enlightened me as to how our initial table and text throughout the site would adhere to these guidelines. We went with tables as opposed to divs based on our mutual codecademy experience.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML) While on my own I am so very tempted to format content directly with HTML, my peer was there to remind me to keep to basic guidelines.
- What seems good and bad about HTML? - HTML is awesome because it is so elegantly minimalist. With just a few of tags you can breathe some life into text. The downside to HTML is that same minimalism. If you want to give your webpage some more complexity, you may find yourself trying to use more and more tags to accomplish a simple design. This is where CSS comes in handy though.  
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
-When writing HTML, I keep in mind that, just like a person, an html doc needs a head and a body. As for the tags, I attempt to keep HTML in plain english in my mind while typing it out. For example, I usually say 'table data' in my head while typing out '<td>', or say 'image source' when typing out 'img src'.
