# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.

# my_array_finding_method:

# I implemented an array method '.select' which creates a new array based on the block you pass it!
# As you can see, in the block after '.select' still on line 11 I was able to then use the '.include?' method to efficiently check if any item(s) in the new arracy included the 'thing_to_find'
# the last thing to mention is that I needed to call '.to_s' on each word in the 'inclusive_words' array in case the original array passed to the method inclduded an integer - otherwise '.include?' was not happy and I would get the error "3:Fixnum (NoMethodError)"

# my_hash_finding_method:

# In this one I used the hash method '.keep_if' (after first duplicating the hash into a new hash so the method is NOT destructive)
# This method iterates through the given hash and deletes key-value pairs that do not meet the criteria in following block
# then I used the '.keys' hash method to return only the keys of my 'inclusive_pets' hash (so I got the pet names without the names)

def my_array_modification_method!(source, thing_to_modify)
  source.map! do |x|
   if x.is_a?(Integer)
     x + thing_to_modify

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented.
# For my_array_modification_method! I implemented two methods.  The first one is .map!.  I chose the bang ('!') because the non destructive (map) element creates a new array.  .map! will alter the current array with code a block.  In this instance I did an IF statement in the block.  I checked to see if the element is an integer with .is_a?.  This will return true if the class passed through is true.  So if it is an integer it will add a number to the integer element.
#
#For my_hash_modification_method!  All I used was the .each iterator and modified each value with the number passed through as the arguement.


# Person 3
def my_array_sorting_method(source)
  #Assumes that source this is already an array
  #Most basic argument
  sorted_array = source.sort_by {|x| x.to_s}
  sorted_array
end

p my_array_sorting_method(i_want_pets)

def my_hash_sorting_method(source)
   # source.to.sort_by! {|name, age| age}
   # puts source
   sorted_hash = source.sort {|x,y| x[1] <=> y[1]}
   puts sorted_hash
end

#
p my_hash_sorting_method(my_family_pets_ages)

#In the array method, the original source is sorted alphabetically by using the sort_by method, distinguishing that each element be alphabetical in a string regardless of case.
#The hash method is a bit trickier, breaking the elements of the source into their own arrays and then ordering those original hash elements by their values (in this case, the ages of the animals).
