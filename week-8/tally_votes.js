// Pseudocode
// Input:  Votes objects
// Output:  
//    1.  Tally votes in the vote tally
//    2.  Select the max vote getter by position
// Steps:
//    1. Set up loop to go through each person's vote
//    2. Set up loop to go through all positions per each person's vote
//    3. Use some sort of flow control to add when the name is already there vs. create new entry if name is not already there

//     }

// __________________________________________
// Reflection

// What did you learn about iterating over nested objects in JavaScript?
// I learned that the earlier similarities I had seen between Ruby and JS were playing themselves
// out in this exercise. These similar concepts were sorting arrays/hashes and targeting indexed elements.

// Were you able to find useful methods to help you with this?
// The push method was helpful here. We created a new array and pushed the tallied names into it, then returned
// the names with the highest tally. Turning things into arrays has been a common theme these past two weeks I think.

// What concepts were solidified in the process of working through this challenge?
//Objects and their properties/values can be accessed in ways similar to how Ruby hashes are dealt with. Also got to sort with
// arrays once again. This was a coding concept that took me a bit longer to understand when working on it earlier, so I was glad
// try it out again.
